    cd ./docker
    make

# NPG Singularity wrappers

Each container that provides command line programs is self-documenting
and is able to install its own proxy wrappers outside of the container,
to allow these programs to be run transparently.

The images include the singularity-wrapper tool which allows programs to
be listed and their wrappers installed. The install target should be set
to a volume mounted into the container and the -p (install prefix) option
of the tool set accordingly. The -h option will show online help.

e.g. Show online help:

    $ docker run ghcr.io/wtsi-npg/ub-18.04-irods-clients-4.2.11:latest \
        singularity-wrapper -h

e.g. List the programs provided by a container:

    $ docker run ghcr.io/wtsi-npg/ub-18.04-irods-clients-4.2.11:latest \
        singularity-wrapper list
    baton-chmod
    ...
    samtools

e.g. Install wrappers to $PREFIX/bin:

    $ docker run -v $PREFIX:/mnt/tmp \
        ghcr.io/wtsi-npg/ub-18.04-irods-clients-4.2.11:latest \
          singularity-wrapper -p /mnt/tmp install

    $ ls $PREFIX/bin
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 kdj staff 406 Apr 12 15:47 baton-chmod
    ...
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 kdj staff 409 Apr 12 15:47 samtools
